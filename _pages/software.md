[ANT](https://payamsash.github.io/ANT/)
  
  ANT is an open-source framework for real-time M/EEG analysis and visualization, offering a full-featured pipeline for neuroimaging research:
- Real-time feature extraction from M/EEG signals.
- Multi-level processing, from sensor-space to source-space analyses.
- 3D brain visualization, mapping activation onto a reconstructed brain from the subject’s MRI.
- Neurofeedback integration, enabling real-time monitoring of responses.
- Artifact correction in real time, including:
  - ORICA (Online Recursive ICA) for source separation
  - Adaptive regression (LMS) to remove EEG blink artifacts
  - Real-time SSP (Signal Space Projection) for MEG artifact removal
  - HFC correction for high-frequency MEG artifacts
- Lightweight project management, for organized and efficient experimentation.
- Flexible and extensible tools suitable for neuroimaging, visualization, and neurofeedback applications.

[TIDE](https://github.com/payamsash/TIDE)

 TIDE focuses on the identification and validation of a biomarker for tinnitus, providing a personalized, data-driven approach to chronic tinnitus diagnosis:
- Full and semi-automatic preprocessing and analysis of EEG data
- Unified file management for data collected from multiple sites and paradigms
- Tools specifically designed for tinnitus biomarker discovery
  

[Neurograph](https://github.com/payamsash/Neurograph)
  
  Neurograph enables graph learning from smooth signals derived from M/EEG or fMRI data, supporting advanced analyses of brain connectivity and network dynamics.
